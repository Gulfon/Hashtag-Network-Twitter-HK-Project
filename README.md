# Hashtag-Network-Twitter-HK-Project
This is a repository for the Hong Kong protest twitter discussion network dataset and analysis.

It contains the script files for accessing the full archive provided by Twitter API v2, and scripts for creating and analysing a retweet network based on the output. 

It also contains the truncated data for the #StandWithHongKong hashtag. The full csv and rdata files are too large but can be found here:
